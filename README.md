# DuelDansLeCiel
Second tutored project in L1 Computer Science

The project proposal comes from Joseph Razik (http://razik.univ-tln.fr/duel-dans-le-ciel.html). It has been coded and organized to be as modifiable as possible while being as clean as possible in terms of structure. Everything related to the graphical window comes from a library named cng developed by Christian Nguyen and Joseph Razik. This library has been modified to meet my needs.

/!\ THOSE INSTALLATIONS ARE REQUIRED /!\

  - Python 3.9.x
  - install Pillow module (python -m pip Pillow)
  - install pyglet module (python -m pip pyglet)
  - download the ambiant music (https://www.mediafire.com/file/knl27x5hi5evgl2/sounds.rar/file or https://www.transfernow.net/dl/20210601SZrKHBg0) and place it in "sounds" folder

After theses installations, you need to run the "game.py" file with python3.9

In the futur, some things will be added:

  - correct trajecories
  - homing missile
  - congratulation to the winner
  - introduce weather
  - shoot with rdm degrees (increase with damage and change with airplane type and weather)
